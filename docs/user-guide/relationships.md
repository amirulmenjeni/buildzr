# Relationships
Relationships connect elements in your architecture model and describe how they interact. Think of them as the gossip lines of your system - who talks to whom, what they're saying, and whether they're doing it over HTTP or carrier pigeon. Without relationships, your architecture diagram is just a bunch of lonely boxes that desperately need therapy.[^1]

With that in mind, let's dive into how we can establish and maintain a healthy relationship with `buildzr`.

## Basic Syntax

To define a relationship between two models, use the `>>` operator.

```python
from buildzr.dsl import Workspace, Person, SoftwareSystem

with Workspace('w') as w:

    user = Person('User')
    system = SoftwareSystem('System')

    # Simple relationship
    user >> system
```

## Adding Descriptions

To describe what kind of relationship exists between `user` and `system`, simply pass a string like so:

```python
from buildzr.dsl import Workspace, Person, SoftwareSystem

with Workspace('w') as w:

    user = Person('User')
    system = SoftwareSystem('System')

    user >> "Uses" >> system
```

## Technology/Protocol

If you need to add the technology detail, pass a tuple instead of a string. The first element of the tuple is the description, while the second is the technology.

```python
from buildzr.dsl import Workspace, SoftwareSystem, Container

with Workspace('w') as w:

    with SoftwareSystem('s') as s:
        api = Container('API')
        database = Container('Database')

    # Relationship with description and technology
    api >> ("Reads from and writes to", "JDBC/SSL") >> database
```

## Adding Tags and Properties to a Relationship

Like element models, you can also add tags and properties to relationships by piping (`|`) the relationship to a `With`:

```python
from buildzr.dsl import Workspace, SoftwareSystem, Container, With

with Workspace('w') as w:

    with SoftwareSystem('s') as s:
        api = Container('API')
        database = Container('Database')

    # Relationship with description and technology
    api >> ("Reads from and writes to", "JDBC/SSL") >> database | With(
        tags={'sensitive'},
        properties={
            'driver': 'mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar',
        }
    )
```

## One-to-Many Relationships

It is also possible to define a one-to-many relationships by collecting the right-hand hand side of the `>>` in a list (`[ ... ]`):

```python
from buildzr.dsl import Workspace, Person, SoftwareSystem, With, desc

with Workspace('w') as w:
    user = Person('user')
    system_a = SoftwareSystem('a')
    system_b = SoftwareSystem('b')
    auth_system = SoftwareSystem('auth')

    user >> [
        desc("Reads from") >> system_a,
        desc("Writes to", "HTTPS") >> system_b | With(
            tags={'encrypted'},
        ),
        auth_system,
    ]
```

You can see that we've combined different ways to define a relationship for each relationship between `user` and `system_a`, `system_b`, and `auth_system`!

!!! note
    Use `desc` when describing relationships in a one-to-many relationships definition.
    This is required, unless you don't need to put a relationship description like with `auth_system` above!


## Bidirectional Relationships

Sometimes relationships go both ways. When system A talks to system B *and* system B talks back to system A, you've got a bidirectional relationship - the "it's complicated" of architecture diagrams.

You can create relationships in both directions by defining each direction separately:

```python
from buildzr.dsl import Workspace, Person, SoftwareSystem, With, desc

with Workspace('w') as w:
    system_a = SoftwareSystem('a')
    system_b = SoftwareSystem('b')

    system_a >> "Calls" >> system_b

    system_b >> "Sends events to" >> system_a
```

!!! tip
    Just because you *can* make relationships bidirectional doesn't mean they are. Only add the reverse relationship if it actually exists in your system.

## Implied Relationships

Sometimes you don't need to say the obvious. If your `frontend` container talks to someone else's `api` container, it's pretty clear that your system talks to their system too. These are implied relationships - connections that exist by logical necessity, not because you explicitly wrote them down.

```python
from buildzr.dsl import Workspace, Person, SoftwareSystem, Container

# ⚠️ Make sure to enable `implied_relationships` for the workspace!
with Workspace('w', implied_relationships=True) as w:
    user = Person('user')
    with SoftwareSystem('s') as s:
        app = Container('app')

    # This will also imply that `user >> s`.
    user >> app
```

If you run the code above and inspect the JSON output, you'll see that `user` has two relationships:

- The first one with `app`, which was explicitly created, and
- The second one with `s`, which was implied

!!! info "Why This Matters"
    Implied relationships save you from maintaining duplicate relationship definitions across different abstraction levels. Define the detailed container-to-container relationship once, and the system-to-system relationship is inferred automatically. One source of truth, multiple levels of visualization.

!!! info "Implied Relationships are Bidirectional"
    If we have software systems `a` and `b`, each with containers `ca` and `cb` respectively, the following holds:
    - `a.ca >> b` implies `a >> b`
    - `a >> b.cb` implies `a >> b`

## Legal Relationships

As you may know, not all relationships are legal.

`buildzr` helps you know if you're creating a legal relationship by using `mypy`, a static type checker.

For example, if you try to create a relationship between a `Person` and an `DeploymentNode` (ew!), `mypy` will complain, and you'll see something like this:

![Mypy complains about an illegal relationship](./images/mypy_illegal_relationship.png){ width="400" }

If we hover over the red squiggly lines, we can read the complaints:

```
No overload variant of "__rshift__" of "DslElementRelationOverrides" matches argument type "DeploymentNode".

Possible overload variants:
    def __rshift__(self, Union[Person, SoftwareSystem, Container, Component], /) -> _Relationship[Person, Union[Person, SoftwareSystem, Container, Component]]
    def __rshift__(self, Tuple[str, str], /) -> _UsesFrom[Person, Union[Person, SoftwareSystem, Container, Component]]
    def __rshift__(self, str, /) -> _UsesFrom[Person, Union[Person, SoftwareSystem, Container, Component]]
    def __rshift__(self, _RelationshipDescription[Union[Person, SoftwareSystem, Container, Component]], /) -> _UsesFrom[Person, Union[Person, SoftwareSystem, Container, Component]]
    def __rshift__(self, List[Union[Person, SoftwareSystem, Container, Component, _UsesFromLate[Union[Person, SoftwareSystem, Container, Component]]]], /) -> List[_Relationship[Person, Union[Person, SoftwareSystem, Container, Component]]]
```

The following table shows the allowed relationships between which element types, and from which source to which destination (taken from [Structurizr DSL Language Reference](https://docs.structurizr.com/dsl/language#relationship)):

|Source|Destination|
|---|---|
|`Person`|`Person`, `SoftwareSystem`, `Container`, `Component`|
|`SoftwareSystem`|`Person`, `SoftwareSystem`, `Container`, `Component`|
|`Container`|`Person`, `SoftwareSystem`, `Container`, `Component`|
|`Component`|`Person`, `SoftwareSystem`, `Container`, `Component`|
|`DeploymentNode`|`DeploymentNode`|
|`InfrastructureNode`|`DeploymentNode`, `InfrastructureNode`, `SoftwareSystemInstance`, `ContainerInstance`|
|`SoftwareSystemInstance`|`InfrastructureNode`|
|`ContainerInstance`|`InfrastructureNode`|

Note that the table shows that `SoftwareSystemInstance` and `ContainerInstance` can only have a relationship with `InfrastructureNode`. Behind the scene, though, when you create a relationship, say, between two `Container`s, `buildzr` will create the implied instance relationships between the instances of the two `ContainerInstance`s if they exists. For an example of this, see the [Deployment Group example](./models.md#deployment-group). (This is a different feature, not to be confused with from what's described in [Implied Relationships](#implied-relationships).)
